# 12_Random_Forest

## 📌 Module Overview
This module covers **Random Forest**, an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to produce more accurate and stable predictions.

Random Forest reduces overfitting by averaging multiple models trained on different subsets of data.
