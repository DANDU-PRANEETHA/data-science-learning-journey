# 06_Hypothesis_Testing

## 📌 Module Overview
This module introduces **Hypothesis Testing**, a core concept in statistics used to make data-driven decisions and validate assumptions using sample data.

Hypothesis testing helps determine whether observed results are **statistically significant** or occurred by chance.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Null and Alternative Hypothesis
- Level of Significance (α)
- p-value interpretation
- Test statistics
- Type I and Type II errors

---

## 📊 Topics Included

- One-sample hypothesis tests
- Two-sample hypothesis tests
- Z-test
- T-test (one-sample, two-sample, paired)
- Chi-Square test
- ANOVA basics
- Choosing the right statistical test

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Followed

1. Define null and alternative hypotheses  
2. Choose significance level (α)  
3. Select appropriate statistical test  
4. Calculate test statistic and p-value  
5. Make a decision (Reject / Fail to Reject H₀)
